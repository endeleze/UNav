# üó∫Ô∏è UNav: Unified Visual Navigation System

A **modular, scalable visual navigation framework** for large buildings, supporting mapping, localization, and pathfinding across multiple floors and buildings. Designed for real-world deployment in robotics, assistive navigation, and digital twin scenarios.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before using UNav, ensure the following are installed:

- **Python 3.8+** (`requirements.txt`)
- **CUDA-compatible GPU** (recommended for feature extraction/matching)
- **Docker** (required for SLAM mapping with stella_vslam_dense)
- **COLMAP** (for triangulation; should be on your `$PATH`)
- **labelme** (for annotating floorplans)
- **[stella_vslam_dense](https://github.com/RoblabWh/stella_vslam_dense.git)** (SLAM mapping via Docker)
- **[implicit_dist](https://github.com/cvg/implicit_dist.git)** (multi-frame pose refinement)
- **[PoseLib](https://github.com/vlarsson/PoseLib)** (robust pose estimation)

**Quick setup for SLAM:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RoblabWh/stella_vslam_dense.git
cd stella_vslam_dense/docker
docker build -t stella_vslam_dense .
```

## üöÄ One-command Installation (All-in-One)

Install all UNav functionality (mapping, localization, navigation) with one command:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/ai4ce/unav.git
```

## üèÅ Getting Started (Full System Workflow)

Below is the **essential workflow to construct a metrically registered, navigation-ready environment**:

1. **Mapping:**  
   Run the mapping pipeline to generate 3D map, slice images, extract features, perform matching, and triangulate points.

   ```sh
   python main_mapping_pipeline.py <data_temp_root> <data_final_root> <feature_model> <place> <building> <floor>
   ```

   Example:
   ```sh
   python main_mapping_pipeline.py /mnt/data/UNav-IO/temp /mnt/data/UNav-IO/data DinoV2Salad New_York_City LightHouse 4_floor
   ```

2. **Align 3D Map to Floorplan (Required):**  
   This step **is mandatory** for metric localization and navigation.  
   Launch the alignment GUI to register SLAM map coordinates to the architectural floorplan.

   ```sh
   python mapper/aligner.py <data_temp_root> <data_final_root> <place> <building> <floor>
   ```

   You must repeat this for every mapped floor/building.

3. **Localization & Navigation:**  
   Use the generated outputs for real-time localization and navigation.  
   See example usage and API in the `localizer/` and `navigator/` folders and [project documentation](https://github.com/ai4ce/unav).

## üìù Example Notebooks

- `visualize_mapping.ipynb`  
  Visualize mapping results: point clouds, camera trajectories, feature quality.
- `visualize_localization.ipynb`  
  Inspect localization performance, candidate matches, and pose transformation.
- `visualize_navigation.ipynb`  
  Simulate navigation, visualize multi-floor routes, and review generated commands.
